\section{Introduction}
The \textbf{\textit{FARM}} plug-in is a generalized module for supervised control within RAVEN.
\\The plug-in is aimed to compute the admissible actuator range for a system control, which is 
important to avoid operational constraints violation.
\\This document is aimed to report and explain the  \textbf{\textit{FARM}} plug-in software requirements. 
In addition, it reports the traceability matrix between software requirements and requirement tests 
(tests that testify the software is compliant with respect its own requirements).
