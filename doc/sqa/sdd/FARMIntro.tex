\section{Introduction}
\subsection{System Purpose}

The \textbf{\textit{FARM}} plug-in is a generalized module for supervisory control within RAVEN.
\\RAVEN is a flexible and multi-purpose uncertainty quantification (UQ), regression analysis, probabilistic risk assessment 
(PRA), data analysis and model optimization software.  Depending on the tasks to be accomplished and on the 
probabilistic
 characterization of the problem, RAVEN perturbs (Monte-Carlo, Latin hyper-cube, reliability surface search, etc.) the
 response of the system under consideration by altering its own parameters. 
 The data generated by the sampling process is analyzed using classical statistical
 and more advanced data mining approaches. RAVEN also manages the parallel dispatching (i.e. both on
 desktop/workstation and large High-Performance Computing machines) of the software representing the physical 
 model.
 For more information about the RAVEN software, see ~\cite{RAVENuserManual} and the RAVEN website (\url{https://raven.inl.gov})
\\The  \textbf{\textit{FARM}} module is a dedicated plug-in module of RAVEN.
A RAVEN plug-in is a software/module/library that has been developed to be linked to RAVEN at run-time, using the RAVEN APIs.


\subsection{System Scope}

The \textbf{\textit{FARM}} plug-inâ€™s scope is to provide the capability to compute the optimal value and the admissible range of 
actuator variables, given the state-space representation of system dynamics, to avoid any violation of system operational 
constraints.

 The main objective of the module (in conjunction with the RAVEN software) is to assist the engineer/user to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item predict the future evolution of system state and output variables when imposing a given value of actuator;
  \item adjust the actuator value in order to keep the critical variables within the range defined by operational constraints;
  \item provide the actuator admissible range to aid further analysis, such as power dispatch optimization.
\end{itemize}

In other words, the  \textbf{\textit{FARM}} plug-in (driven by RAVEN) is aimed to be employed for:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Dynamic system behavior prediction;
  \item System supervisory control.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{User Characteristics}

The users of the \textbf{\textit{FARM}} plug-in are expected to be part of any of the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Core developers (FARM core team)}: These are the developers of the \textbf{\textit{FARM}}  plug-in. They will be 
    responsible for following
    and enforcing the appropriate software development standards. They will be responsible for designing, implementing and 
    maintaining the plug-in.
  \item \textbf{External developers}: A Scientist or Engineer that utilizes the \textbf{\textit{FARM}}  plug-in and wants to 
    extend its capabilities. This user will typically have a background in modeling and 
    simulation techniques and/or numerical and data analysis but may only have a limited skill-set 
    when it comes to object-oriented coding, C++/Python languages.
  \item \textbf{Analysts}:  These are users that will run the plug-in (in conjunction with RAVEN) and perform various analysis on the 
  simulations they perform. These users may interact with developers of the system requesting new features and reporting bugs found 
  and will typically make heavy use of the input file format.
\end{itemize}
