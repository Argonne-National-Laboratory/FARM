\section{Introduction}
The \textbf{\textit{FARM}} plug-in is a generalized module for supervised control within RAVEN.
\\The plug-in is aimed to compute the admissible actuator range for a system control, which is 
important to avoid operational constraints violation.
\\This document is aimed to report the traceability matrix between software requirements
(see FARM SRS) and requirement tests (tests that testify the module/plug-in is compliant
with respect its own requirements).
